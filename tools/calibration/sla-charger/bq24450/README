PCB for SLA Battery charger using TI BQ24450 IC.
- Implemention of Fig.8 schematics from the datasheet.
- Using Darlington transistor
- Spreadsheet for resisors calculation and power dissipation estimation.
- Under Voltage Detection (UVD)
- Power On / Charging / UVD LEDs

ChangeLog:

Rev. C (14 April 2019)
- Fixed issue when the power is switched on and the battery is in floating mode only.
  The issue was resolved with adding 1uF capacitor accross the Rdx resistors.
- Changed Under Voltage Detector resistors divider values to fullfill >100uA requirement from the TC54 datasheet 

Rev. B (22 March 2018)
- Fixed missing connection between Vin and LED supply rail
- Decreased sense resistors to 3 only.
- Decreased PCB size
- Added double resistors for fine addjustments 

Rev. A (21 December 2018)
Prototype initial revision with 7 sense resistors. This version was not stored into the github.
