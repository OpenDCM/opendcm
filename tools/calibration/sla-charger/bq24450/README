PCB for SLA Battery charger using TI BQ24450 IC.

- Implemention of Fig. 8 and 9a schematics taken from the IC datasheet.
- Darlington transistor.
- Spreadsheet for resisors calculation and power dissipation estimation.
- Under Voltage Detection (UVD).
- Input polarity protection.
- LDO output.
- Power On / Charging / UVD LEDs.

ChangeLog:

Rev. D (24 May 2019)
- Added polarity protection.
- Added schematics for custom I tapper value (not the defualt one 10% from charging current).
   This will allow the PCB to be used in the cases when a load is permanently connected to the battery.
- Updated the calculation document.
- Removed the capacitor from the rev. C.
- Increased tracks width.
This version of the PCB is not yet produced and tested.

Rev. C (14 April 2019)
- Fixed issue when the power is switched on and the battery is in floating mode only.
  The issue was resolved with adding 1uF capacitor accross the Rdx resistors.
- Changed Under Voltage Detector resistors divider values to fullfill >100uA requirement from the TC54 datasheet 
This version of the PCB is not yet produced and tested.

Rev. B (22 March 2018)
- Fixed missing connection between Vin and LED supply rail
- Decreased sense resistors to 3 only.
- Decreased PCB size.
- Added double resistors for coarse/fine addjustments.

Rev. A (21 December 2018)
Prototype initial revision with 7 sense resistors. This version was not stored into the github.
